# Building from source
If you wish to build this from source, simply open the solution in Visual Studio (2019 preferred). You must have the .NET Core 3.1 SDK installed, which comes with most Visual Studio installations. Restore packages for the solution and build the solution.

You can also publish the `BottomGear` project to a folder, which will generate a single .exe file as well as copy the default config.json.
